# Exercises for Next Lecture (assign as homework)
## 1. Implement a class that utilizes advanced constructor chaining.

Your first task is to implement a class named `BankAccount` that utilizes advanced constructor chaining. The class should have the following attributes: `accountNumber`, `accountType`, `balance`, and `ownerName`. Provide multiple constructors to initialize these attributes, employing constructor chaining to reuse code.

**Task Conditions:**

- The `BankAccount` class should have at least four constructors.
- Use constructor chaining to initialize the attributes.
- Include a method `displayAccountDetails` to display the account details.

Here's a hint: Your base constructor might only initialize the `accountNumber`, while the other constructors initialize additional attributes by chaining to the base constructor.

## 2. Write a method that demonstrates the use of `varargs` in method overloading.

Your second task is to write a method that demonstrates the use of `varargs` in method overloading. Create a class named `MathOperations` and implement two overloaded methods named `calculateAverage`. One method should accept an array of integers, and the other should accept `varargs`.

**Task Conditions:**

- The `MathOperations` class should contain two methods named `calculateAverage`.
- One method should accept an array of integers.
- The other method should accept a variable number of integer arguments using `varargs`.
- Both methods should calculate and return the average of the numbers passed to them.

Here's a hint: To distinguish between the two methods, you might consider printing a message within each method to indicate which one is being called.
