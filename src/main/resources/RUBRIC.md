#### Exercise 1: Implement a Class that Utilizes Advanced Constructor Chaining (50 Points)

- **Correctness of Code (20 Points)**
    - All attributes (`accountNumber`, `accountType`, `balance`, `ownerName`) are properly declared and initialized.

- **Use of Constructor Chaining (15 Points)**
    - Effective use of constructor chaining to initialize attributes, with no redundant code.

- **Method to Display Account Details (10 Points)**
    - Implementation of a `displayAccountDetails` method that correctly displays all the account attributes.

- **Code Style and Documentation (5 Points)**
    - Code is well-organized, with appropriate comments and follows Java naming conventions.

#### Exercise 2: Write a Method that Demonstrates the Use of `Varargs` in Method Overloading (50 Points)

- **Correctness of Code (20 Points)**
    - Both methods (`calculateAverage`) are implemented and return the correct average.

- **Use of `Varargs` (15 Points)**
    - Effective use of `varargs` in one of the `calculateAverage` methods, allowing for a variable number of arguments.

- **Method Overloading (10 Points)**
    - Properly overloaded `calculateAverage` methods, each capable of handling different parameter types (array and `varargs`).

- **Code Style and Documentation (5 Points)**
    - Code is well-organized, with appropriate comments and follows Java naming conventions.
